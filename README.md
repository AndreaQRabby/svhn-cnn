# **Teaching my PC how to read numbers**
## A convolutional NN for the SVHN Dataset
  
The scope of this Notebook is to build and fit a fairy simple model that is able to recognize and predict the house numbers in images taken from Google Street View. 

I will tackle the problem with a **Convolutional Neural Network** that was conceived for a similar, yet far more complex, task: that of License Plate Detection and Recognition (LPDR). 
I have successfully used the same model on the huge (about 130.000 unique images) Chinese City Parking Dataset, with slow but precise results.

All the ideas behind my work are explained in much greater details in [this article on my website](https://www.andreapasotti.it/home/statistics/teaching-my-pc-to-read-numbers/), therefore feel free to read it if you want! ðŸ˜Š

## IN THIS PROJECT
- SVHN_CNN.ipynb := Colab Notebook to fit the model

- WEIGHTS := https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hUByvVTCLsZkMKCKpTcT2EuAdT7vBO8g?usp=sharing

P.S. I am definitely far from being an expert in NNs, and the same applies for Python programming (which is not yet my main language) so please fogive my (sometimes) bad code :)
